    <p> My name is Julianah Babatunde. I'm a 17 year old girl and I love programming. I would like to brief us on my experience at GOMYCODE so far. </p>
    <br>
    <p> My passion for programmming led me to GOMYCODE to learn Web Development. I remember we talked about Web Fundamentals in the class and how the web works on my first day. Learning the HTTP protocol, the web, URL and servers and clients. <br> <br> On day 2, we learnt about Git and GitHub, how they are different. We did cool stuff like creating directories on our machine, adding files then pushing it to our repositories on GitHub. <br> <br> Presently, we are learning HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). We talked about HTML tags and attributes, tags like the paragraph tag used in giving right indentation your to work and also the anchor tag used in linking from one web page to another and in this anchor tag, we talked about the href attribute which is used to specify the page which the link goes to. <br> We also talked about the bold tag, strong tag, the image tag and many others and the amazing part is that I used these tags to write this essay but you cannot see it because when writing an HTML page, only the contents in the HTML body tag will be visibly to all who view the page.  And... This is a summary of my experience so far at GOMYCODE. </p>
