    <h1 align ="center"> Teens Boot Camp </h1>
    <p> Teens boot camp, a yearly program happening in my church, Lighthouse. A program where teens come together from different races of life to achieve goals. </p>
    <br>
    <p> This year was another wonderful experience for me at TBC. It was really fun-filled as we were able to make new friends, and very important and interesting topics were treated such as vision boarding, knowing God, internet etiquette, gaming, and more. I always look forward to TBC every year. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The TBC of this year started on the 24th of August, 2022, and ended on the 26th of August, 2022. Although costs were applied it was all worth it. </p>
    <br>
    <p> On the first day, we started with vision boarding which was quite fun as we were allowed to express our dreams on cardboard provided with magazines. It was awesome because I wrote about my wanting to learn how to cook, my love for books, art, fashion, and adventures. On my vision board, I expressed my dreams of becoming an astronaut, you knowðŸ˜Ž, itâ€™s cool. Still, on the first day, one of our coaches taught us about leading ourselves and not being allowed to be led or influenced by the world. Towards the end of the class, I figured out that we all have influencers in the sense that a person might have seen someone he/she loves his/her dressing, and then such person gradually wishes to start dressing like that person he/she saw and eventually, he/she does. We might think we cannot be influenced by people but one way or another, we have been influenced without us even noticing except if we look closely. </p>
    <br>
    <p> I agreed with that because I know I have been influenced by people in my mode of dressing, talking, and more. </p>
    <br>
    <p> After that first class, we talked about bibliography, how the old testament was written in Hebrew and how the new testament was written in Greek and little Aramaic. After a few hours, we were served and we had more fun afterward. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Moving to day 2, we did exercises for 30 minutes in the morning. After the physical activities, we all moved to class where we had another awesome time with Mr. John who taught us about emotions and how it can impact how we think. Anyways, I will say emotions can affect the trajectory of our lives and this is an acronym of our ACT. </p>
    <br>
    <p> A = Attitudes </p>
    <br>
    <p> C = Changes </p>
    <br>
    <p> T = Things </p>
    <br>
    <p> After the teachings, I was sitting alone when a male fellow came and sat beside me, I was surprised because I knew I was the least you could find friendly because I usually talk less compared to others. The fellow was a first-timer. At that moment, I was playing games on my phone when he told me he would like to play also. We had fun playing games on my phone. It was fun. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The last day was awesome. Something bizarre and unexpected happened. Remember I said something about me and a guy talking and playing phone games the previous day? Well, our coach asked him who his friend was in the class because everyone knew he was always quiet, almost immediately, he pointed at me. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Everyone looked at me instantly because they knew that I barely talked to anyone. So how come I now have a friend?ðŸ˜‚ Sincerely, I was also kind of surprised because the male fellow and I barely talked but it was also cool because, obviously, someone wanted and sees me as a friend. </p>
    <br> 
    <p> So after that incident, we chatted and exchanged contacts. </p>
    <br>
    <p> All the teachings have been done for that day so we ate and played. We then did physical fitness even though it was kind of funny to me, I enjoyed it. Then few minutes before we finished TBC, we presented our vision boards individually. Although I was kind of nervous because I have stage fright, I overcame it and did my presentation and it felt awesome. </p>
    <br>
    <p> I know next year is going to be another fantastic experience. </p>
